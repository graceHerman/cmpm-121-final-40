# Devlog Entry - [Nov 13, 2024]
## Introducing the team 

Tools Lead - Dexter Hoang

Engine Lead - Alan Lu

Design Leads - Grace Herman, Yingting Huang

## Tools and Materials
1. For our final project, we intend to use Phaser 3. This is because we have worked with Phaser 3 in CMPM120.

2. The programming languages our team chose was Typescript and JSON. This is because we have a lot of experience using Typescript from this class so we wouldn't have to learn an entirely new langauge. 

3. We plan on using VSCode for writing our code because it is easy for us to collaborate and has tools to easily commit and push changes to our repository. If we have to create visual assets, we will use Pixilart or MagicaVoxel for 2d assets. We chose these tools since most of us have experience using these from a previous class. We are also the most comfortable using a more pixelated style of art for our visual assets. 

4. For our alternate platform, we decided we will still stick with Phaser 3, but our primary lanaguge used will change from Typescript to Javascript. This is because of the many similarities between Typescript and Javascript which will help us greatly when changing our code. 

## Outlook 
Our team hopes to complete this final project in a timely manner without having to rush before the due date. The hardest part of this project would be if we have to make a switch to a different platform/engine. This will not only impact our time, but will require us to transfer our work to an entirely new engine with may differ from our original platform. We are hoping to learn more about our platform and feel more comfortable using it for the future.
